Morse Code is a method of encoding text using sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-) to represent letters, numbers, and symbols. It was originally used in telegraphy and is still used in aviation, emergency signaling, and amateur radio. For example:

1) A/a in Morse : .-
2) B/b in Morse : -...

Both lower and upper cases are treated the same in morse code.
